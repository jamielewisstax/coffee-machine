# Coffee machine

A virtual coffee machine that can serve you a latte, espresso or cappuccino.

## Project description
It asks the user what type of coffee they want. They then have to enter money, namely quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies.
The program will calculate if the machine has enough resources to make the coffee and if the user has given enough money.
If both are true, then they will receive their change and their coffee.
Current available resources can be checked by typing 'report'.
The user can also turn the coffee machine off by typing 'off'.
